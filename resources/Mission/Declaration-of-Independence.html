              <p>
                A Declaration by the People of the United States of America,
                When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for
                one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected
                them with a government that has long ceased to represent them,
                and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and
                equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God
                entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of humankind
                requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to
                this separation.
              </p>
              <p class="indent-8">
                We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all people are
                created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with
                certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty,
                the pursuit of Happiness, and the inherent right to a society
                that protects the health of its citizens, the dignity of their
                labor, the security of their homes, and the sanctity of their
                vote.
              </p>
              <p class="indent-8">
                That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among
                People, deriving their just powers from the consent of the
                governed. That whenever any Form of Government becomes
                destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to
                alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying
                its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in
                such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their
                Safety and Happiness.
              </p>

              <p class="indent-8">
                Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established
                should not be changed for light and transient causes; and
                accordingly all experience hath shewn, that humankind are more
                disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right
                themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
                But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing
                invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under
                absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to
                throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their
                future security.
              </p>
              <p class="indent-8">
                Such has been the patient sufferance of these States; and such
                is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former
                Systems of Government. The history of the present ruling
                powers a corrupt duopoly of captured parties, beholden not to
                the citizenry but to a permanent political class and their
                corporate benefactors, culminating in a fascist regime that
                openly disdains democratic norms is a history of repeated
                injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the
                establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove
                this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
            </p>

                 <li>They have surrendered our sovereignty to the rule of money,
                openly allowing corporate donors and billionaires to purchase
                our laws, our elections, and our officials, rendering the voice
                of the people meaningless.</li> 
                
                <li>They have systematically dismantled
                the sacred right to vote, erecting barriers to the ballot box
                through partisan gerrymandering, voter purges, and the
                criminalization of election administration to choose their
                voters, rather than allowing the voters to choose their
                representatives. </li>
                
                <li>They have created a permanent political class,
                refusing term limits and accountability, and have weaponized the
                judiciary, installing ideological loyalists to entrench minority
                rule for a generation. 
                
                <li>They have obstructed Justice at every
                turn, shielding the powerful from consequences, abusing the
                pardon power, and defying the lawful oversight of the people's
                representatives. </li>
                
                <li>They have waged a war on truth itself,
                financing and propagating disinformation to sow division, fear,
                and hatred among us for their own political gain. </li>
                
                <li>They have
                built an economy of speculation and extraction, where the
                dignity of work is crushed by the tyranny of Wall Street, and
                the wages of the many are sacrificed for the profits of the few.</li>

                <li>They have protected corporate monopolies that strangle small
                businesses, raise prices on families, and poison our environment
                with impunity.</li>
                
                <li>They have denied the people their fundamental
                rights to healthcare and education, transforming them into
                commodities that generate crippling debt and unimaginable
                suffering. </li>
                
                <li>They have abolished fundamental rights to privacy and
                bodily autonomy, subjecting the most personal decisions of a
                citizen to the whims of a radical few. </li>
                
                <li>They have maintained and
                profited from a system of mass incarceration, targeting the poor
                and marginalized while protecting the crimes of the wealthy.</li>

                <li>They have engaged in endless foreign wars, spilling the blood
                and treasure of our nation for interests not our own, while
                neglecting the urgent needs of our own communities. </li>
                
                <li>They have,
                in their arrogance, become deaf to the people's pleas for
                justice, for fairness, and for a government that serves the
                common good. </li>

               <p class="indent-8"> In every stage of these Oppressions We have
                Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated
                Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A
                political establishment whose character is thus marked by every
                act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a
                free people. </p>

                <p class="indent-8">We, therefore, the People of the United States of

                rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority
                of the good People of these States, solemnly publish and
                declare, That these United States are, and of Right ought to be,
                Free and Independent from the bonds of this corrupt and
                tyrannical system; that we withdraw our consent from this
                government, and that all political connection between us and the
                permanent political class is and ought to be totally dissolved.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="indent-8">And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on
                the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each
                other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor, to the great
                and necessary work of a Second American Reconstruction, and to
                the founding of a government that is once more of the people, by
                the people, and for the people.
